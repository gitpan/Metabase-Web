These commands create and run a simple CPAN Testers metabase

  $ generate_config.pl /tmp/cpan-testers-metabase/
  $ cpan-testers-metabase.pl -C /tmp/cpan-testers-metabase/config.json

Or, use the quickstart.pl script.  If you provide a directory, it will
use that, otherwise, it will use temporary one that will be cleaned up when the
server is terminated.

  $ quickstart.pl

Or

  $ quickstart.pl /some/directory
